# Screen-CaPy
An attempted screen capture application with a GUI. I intended to be able to eventually draw a rectangle for the portion of the screen I wanted to record. This would mean I could record any mobile applications on an emulator and record just the relevant part of the screen.

I stopped programming this application in Python as after some reading, discovered that Python has trouble producing desirable results faster than 10-15fps. 

I will program this is a faster language - probably Java
